Started repo after watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ncx4H0YmK0&ab_channel=CircuitChronicles)

Wrote gradient descent from scratch.

TODO: Fix bug in gradient_descent.py where we cannot loop more than 29 times (yes, 29) without getting some strange error. Seems serious. possibly memory related. will document the error statement better, later.
